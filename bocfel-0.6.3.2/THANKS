Bocfel would not exist today were it not for the work of many others.  I would
therefore like to thank the following people for their contributions to the
ongoing development of Z-machine related software.


Infocom, for creating the Z-machine and all those games that run on it.

The InfoTaskForce, for first figuring out how the Z-machine works.

Graham Nelson, for Inform, the Z-Machine Standards Document, and generally being
responsible for the resurgence of the Z-machine.

Graham Nelson, because listing him once does not adequately convey just how
instrumental he has been for the Z-machine.

Mark Howell, for Ztools.  I don't think it would have been possible for me to
complete Bocfel without txd, the Z-code disassembler.

Andrew Plotkin, for Glk, as well as his tireless efforts on behalf of the
medium.

Stefan Jokisch, for Frotz.  When I was unclear about particular bits of the
Z-machine standard, peeking at Frotz's source code was very helpful.

Tor Andersson, for Gargoyle, whose Glk implementation is my main target (don't
worry, though, as I fully maintain complete Glk compliance!).

Ben Cressey, for maintaining Gargoyle and keeping its Glk implementation
current, for importing Bocfel into Gargoyle, and for pointing out some bugs and
making suggestions for improving Bocfel.
